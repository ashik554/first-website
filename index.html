        <h3> Professional Web Developer</h3>
        <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a Web site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.</p>

            <p> Dreams are what a person sees and hears in their mind when they are sleeping. They are often similar to real life in some ways, but can also be very strange. Dreams can seem so real while they happen that the person might think that they are awake when actually they are asleep. ... This is called a lucid dream.</p>

            <p>If you want to become a web developer you maybe are thinking of becoming a full-stack developer, and the first step to do that is learning how to become a good front-end developer, and that means, you have to learn first HTML, CSS, and JS, but we will leave JS for another interesting article.</p>

            <p>There is a lot of content throw the web about HTML & CSS, It’s a little guide according to my learning experience, this is just the tip of the iceberg, there is more about HTML & CSS to cover, for instance, there are other topics like the user interface (UI), user experience (UX), CSS frameworks, etc, but first you need to have a basic knowledge and as you go further you will see how you create magic on the web, so do not stop learning. One last thing, learning is not enough, you have to put in practice the concepts, how? well, for instance, cloning a web page you like and see how much you apply what you have learned. If you don’t practice you will forget what you learned.</p>
